				There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as
				yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best
				of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never
				come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
				And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago,
				fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon.
				We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not
				because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will
				serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
				because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
				unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others,
				too.

				The most significant things we can think about, when we think about
				Apollo, is that it has opened for us, for us being the World, a
				challenge of the future. The door is now cracked, but the promise of
				that future lies in the young people, not just in America, but the young
				people all over the world. Learning to live and learning to work
				together. In order to remind all the peoples of the World, in so many
				countries throughout the world, that this is what we all are striving
				for in the future, Jack has picked up a very significant rock, typical
				of what we have here in the valley of Taurus Littrow. It's a rock
				composed of many fragments, of many sizes, and many shapes, probably
				from all parts of the Moon, perhaps billions of years old.
